# Notes

## History

With access to someone's search history, you can recommend similar things to them according to other people who fit the same persona, which is what drives targeting, and thus advertising, and thust marketing, and thus business.

You can establish relevance with someone when you have their history.

You find people _like_ them, and then you sell to them.

## White-labelling

The goal in all business — no matter what it is you're selling — products or services — is ultimately to "queue things up" so that you have the supply ready when it's in demand. Supply _when_ it's in demand.

You start with services and eventually, you don't need to actually hand-deliver anything to the customer or do much of anything at all. At that point, you become a Product Manager.

This is why white-labelling is not only legal, but encouraged — because it keeps the product (ie. The "Earth") "free", while "penalizing" (issuing the "glutton" penalty) the "civilian" for creating excess.

Hacking — Intellectual "piracy" — and "brute force" attacks alike are all challenges to reclaim "shared" property from a competitor — as well as forms of social engineering. They're also illegal.

This is also why people use lame excuses like "It's not yours, either!", "I don't see your name on it!", "You didn't make it yourself...", etc. etc. etc., so on and so forth for until man can fabricate things out of thin air without a respondant (a dependency), sources, and resources.

You can't see the world's fallacies as your own faults — after all, they aren't your fault — and furthermore, the fault lines of the world's fallacies fall along the Code and Law. If you ever feel guilty for something that you shouldn't feel guilty for, it's because you've discovered a fallacy.

We don't make the rules...

If it was up to us, we wouldn't make rules. But because there are problems and misunderstandings in the world, now we have to create rules — to prevent problems which would then require more rules, so on and so forth, for ever, and ever...
